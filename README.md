# Music-Genre-Classification
Music genre classification using several Machine learning techniques.

## Data
For the dataset, we used FMA: A Data-set For Music Analysis. It is an open and easily accessible data-set suitable for evaluating several tasks in MIR.

## Data-Preprocessing
Besides the Music Metadata provided by FMA, we used data from the music itself. As such we used librosa (a python package for music
and audio analysis) to generate images of the spectrograms.

## Models
* Simple 2D CNN on Spectrogram Data
* CRNN
* SimpleCNN
* ResNet50
* Suport Verctor Machine
